3.#The length of a house is 42m and the breath is 34m 
#write a python code that will calculate the perimeter and  the area (separately)
#Then add the perimeter and area together and print out the final results
#Formula: area = length *breadth
#Perimeter = (length +breadth)*2


l=42
b=34
perimeter=(l+b)*2

print("The perimeter is: ", perimeter)
print("The area is: ", area)

add_final=perimeter+area
